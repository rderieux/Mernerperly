# Mernerperly

This project is a replication of the Parker Brothers game of Monopoly, with a silly title. So far it is just the game board all done in TypeScript XML, and CSS. It was good practice as I needed things sideways-lr and rl, rightside up, upside down, and rotated 45 degrees. It also gave me a LOT of experience with both a grid and flex display.
